**_Global threats. Unified insights._**

## 🏷️ What Sets Us Apart

GlobalCVE isn’t just another vulnerability feed. We’re building a transparent, unified, and open-source backbone for global CVE intelligence.

- **Multi-source aggregation**  
  We pull from public feeds across continents — NVD, CIRCL, JVN, ExploitDB, and more — with full attribution and fallback logic.

- **Open by design**  
  No paywalls, no vendor lock-in. Our code is public, our API is free, and our roadmap is community-driven.

- **Minimalist and scalable**  
  Built with serverless architecture and clean UI logic, GlobalCVE is fast, forkable, and easy to integrate.

- **Security-first ethos**  
  We prioritize clarity, provenance, and responsible data use — not marketing fluff or gated dashboards.

- **Built by builders**  
  This isn’t a product. It’s infrastructure. And it’s yours to use, improve, and extend.
