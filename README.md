## 🏷️ What Sets Us Apart

GlobalCVE isn’t just another vulnerability feed. We’re building a transparent, unified, and open-source backbone for global CVE intelligence.

- **Multi-source aggregation**  
  We pull from public feeds across continents — NVD, CIRCL, JVN, ExploitDB, and more — with full attribution and fallback logic.

- **Open by design**  
  No paywalls, no vendor lock-in. Our code is public, our API is free, and our roadmap is community-driven.

- **Minimalist and scalable**  
  Built with serverless architecture and clean UI logic, GlobalCVE is fast, forkable, and easy to integrate.

- **Security-first ethos**  
  We prioritize clarity, provenance, and responsible data use.
- **Built by builders**  
  This isn’t a product. It’s infrastructure. And it’s yours to use, improve, and extend.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- **NVD API Key** (optional, but required for NVD source)

### Getting an NVD API Key
1. Visit [https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)
2. Request a free API key
3. You'll receive it via email

**Note:** If you don't want to use the NVD source, you can skip this step. Other sources like **CISA KEV** cover most critical CVEs and don't require an API key.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jegly/globalcve.git
cd globalcve
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```bash
NVD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.
