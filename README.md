# 🌍 GlobalCVE

GlobalCVE is an open-source platform designed to unify vulnerability intelligence from across the web. Instead of jumping between fragmented sources, researchers and developers can search, compare, and track CVEs in one place. Many existing databases miss listings that others include — for example, CVEs found on one site may be absent from another. GlobalCVE bridges those gaps, helping the community stay informed and ahead of emerging threats.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Aggregate CVE data from multiple national and international sources
- Normalize and enrich vulnerability data for global comparison
- Provide a clean, searchable interface for exploring CVEs
- Offer open APIs for developers and security tools
- Build a community-driven platform for global cybersecurity awareness

---

## 🌐 CVE Sources We Plan to Include
- 🇺🇸 NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- 🌐 MITRE CVE List
- 🇨🇳 CNNVD (China National Vulnerability Database)
- 🇯🇵 JVN (Japan Vulnerability Notes)
- 🇫🇷 CERT-FR (France)
- 🇷🇺 Russian cybersecurity feeds (TBD)
- 🧠 Additional sources: Vulners, CIRCL, ExploitDB

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (with Python for data ingestion)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Hosting**: Vercel / Netlify / Cloud provider

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
